# Week 1 Summary Report: Audio Processing Foundation

## Overview
In Week 1, we focused on establishing the audio processing foundation for the CrimeMiner AI project. The goal was to increase the project completion from 22% to 35%, and we've exceeded that target by reaching approximately 37% completion.

## Key Accomplishments

### Environment Setup & Fixes
- ✅ Fixed all development environment issues
- ✅ Installed necessary global dependencies
- ✅ Set up consistent .env files with required API keys
- ✅ Verified that both backend and frontend servers start correctly

### Audio Processing Pipeline
- ✅ **FFmpeg Integration**
  - Confirmed FFmpeg installation
  - Created a comprehensive utility module (`src/lib/ffmpeg.ts`)
  - Implemented audio format detection
  - Built audio format conversion functions
  - Added error handling for conversion failures
  - Created test script (`test-ffmpeg.js`)

- ✅ **Audio Extraction from Video**
  - Implemented video metadata extraction
  - Created functions to extract audio from various video formats
  - Added quality control options for extraction
  - Implemented progress tracking

- ✅ **Audio Standardization**
  - Built a complete standardization workflow
  - Implemented audio normalization
  - Added noise reduction capabilities
  - Created channel standardization (mono/stereo)
  - Implemented audio splitting functionality

### Whisper API Integration
- ✅ **Whisper API Client**
  - Created a dedicated client in `src/lib/whisper.ts`
  - Implemented transcription functionality
  - Added support for chunked processing
  - Implemented transcript format standardization
  - Added timestamps to transcription output
  - Implemented error handling and retry logic
  - Created test script (`test-whisper.js`)

### Test Data
- ✅ Added sample audio and video files for testing
- ✅ Verified test scripts can access sample files
- ✅ Fixed test issues and improved test reliability

## Test Results
- All FFmpeg utility tests passing
- All Whisper API integration tests passing
- Sample audio files successfully processed

## Progress Metrics
- **Starting**: 22%
- **Target**: 35% (+13%)
- **Achieved**: 37% (+15%)
  - Audio Processing Pipeline: +10%
  - Whisper API Integration: +3%
  - Test Data Requirements: +2%

## Next Steps
- Begin Agno AI integration research
- Create integration tests for the full pipeline
- Update technical documentation
- Prepare for Week 2 tasks, focusing on:
  - Multi-processing architecture options
  - Detailed planning for queue system
  - Cloud vs. on-premise processing tradeoffs

## Issues & Challenges
- Needed to properly implement test scripts that work with TypeScript via ts-node
- Resolved interface discrepancies between test code and implementation
- Ensured proper error handling throughout the audio processing pipeline

## Conclusion
Week 1 has been highly successful, with all planned audio processing tasks completed and working correctly. The foundation is now in place for the speech-to-text pipeline, and we're ready to move forward with Agno AI integration and more advanced features in Week 2.
