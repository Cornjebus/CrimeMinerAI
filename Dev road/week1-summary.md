## Progress Tracking

- **Starting**: 22%
- **Target**: 35% (+13%)
- **Achieved**: 37% (+15%)
  - Audio Processing Pipeline: +10%
  - Whisper API Integration: +3%
  - UI Improvements: +2%
  - Test Data Requirements: +2%

## Next Steps (Week 2 Preview)

- Begin Agno AI integration
- Create processing queue for background tasks
- Implement document OCR capabilities
- Enhance audio and video analysis features
- Create entity extraction from transcribed content

## Issues & Challenges
- Needed to properly implement test scripts that work with TypeScript via ts-node
- Resolved interface discrepancies between test code and implementation
- Ensured proper error handling throughout the audio processing pipeline

## Conclusion
Week 1 has been highly successful, with all planned audio processing tasks completed and working correctly. The foundation is now in place for the speech-to-text pipeline, and we're ready to move forward with Agno AI integration and more advanced features in Week 2.
