# Week 1 Plan: Audio Processing Foundation (March 21-27)

## Goal
Increase project completion from 22% to 35% by establishing the audio processing foundation and beginning Agno AI integration.

## Environment Setup & Fixes

- [x] **Fix development environment issues**
  - [x] Install ts-node-dev globally: `npm install -g ts-node-dev`
  - [x] Verify NPM dependencies are correctly installed in both projects
  - [x] Create consistent .env files with required API keys and configuration
  - [x] Test both backend and frontend servers start correctly

## Audio Processing Pipeline (Target: +10%)

### 1. FFmpeg Integration (+3%)
- [x] **Install and configure FFmpeg**
  - [x] Verify FFmpeg installation: `ffmpeg -version`
  - [x] Create utility module in server project: `src/lib/ffmpeg.ts`
  - [x] Implement basic audio format conversion functions:
    - [x] Audio format detection
    - [x] MP3 conversion
    - [x] WAV conversion
    - [x] Sample rate standardization
  - [x] Create test script for conversion functions
  - [x] Implement error handling for conversion failures

### 2. Audio Extraction from Video (+4%)
- [x] **Create video processing utilities**
  - [x] Implement video metadata extraction using FFmpeg
  - [x] Create function to extract audio tracks from video files
  - [x] Add support for multiple video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI)
  - [x] Implement options for controlling audio quality in extraction
  - [x] Add progress tracking during extraction
  - [x] Create test script for video-to-audio extraction

### 3. Audio Standardization Pipeline (+3%)
- [x] **Build standardization workflow**
  - [x] Create pipeline class for sequential processing
  - [x] Implement audio normalization function
  - [x] Add noise reduction capabilities
  - [x] Implement channel standardization (stereo/mono)
  - [x] Create function for splitting long audio files
  - [x] Add metadata preservation across conversions
  - [x] Create test script to verify standardization pipeline

## Whisper API Integration (Target: +3%)

- [x] **Connect to OpenAI Whisper API**
  - [x] Create dedicated Whisper client in `src/lib/whisper.ts`
  - [x] Implement audio transcription function
  - [x] Add support for processing in chunks
  - [x] Implement speaker diarization (if available)
  - [x] Create transcript format standardization
  - [x] Add timestamps to transcription output
  - [x] Implement error handling and retry logic
  - [x] Create test script for transcription service

## Test Data Requirements

- [x] **Add sample files for testing**
  - [x] Add sample audio files to sample-data directory
  - [x] Add sample video files to sample-data directory
  - [x] Verify test scripts can access the sample files

## Agno AI Setup (Initial Foundation)

- [ ] **Research and plan Agno integration**
  - [ ] Document required Agno libraries and dependencies
  - [ ] Create architecture diagram for Agno integration
  - [ ] Define agent types and responsibilities
  - [ ] Plan knowledge store structure
  - [ ] Identify integration points with existing code

## Integration & Testing

- [ ] **Create integration tests**
  - [ ] Test full pipeline: upload → conversion → transcription
  - [ ] Measure processing times and system performance
  - [ ] Document error cases and handling
  - [ ] Create performance baseline metrics

## Documentation

- [ ] **Update technical documentation**
  - [ ] Document FFmpeg integration and requirements
  - [ ] Create API documentation for new endpoints
  - [ ] Update database schema if needed
  - [ ] Document known limitations and workarounds

## Project Management

- [ ] **Track progress against plan**
  - [ ] Update project roadmap with actual progress
  - [ ] Identify and document any blockers
  - [ ] Adjust timeline if necessary based on progress
  - [ ] Prepare status report for week-end review

## Next Steps Preview

- Research multi-processing architecture options
- Begin detailed planning for queue system
- Evaluate cloud vs. on-premise processing tradeoffs
