# CrimeMiner AI Sample Data

This directory contains sample data files for testing and demonstrating the CrimeMiner AI platform's capabilities. These files are provided for development and testing purposes only.

## Audio Samples

### sample-interview.txt
A transcript of a mock police interview that can be used to test the text analysis features. Contains entities, patterns, and sentiments that the system should be able to detect.

### sample-audio-instructions.md
Instructions for obtaining sample audio files for testing the audio transcription and reference system features. Due to file size limitations, actual audio files are not included in the repository.

## How to Use Sample Data

1. **Text Analysis Testing**:
   - Use `sample-interview.txt` with the text analysis endpoints to test entity extraction, summarization, sentiment analysis, and pattern identification.

2. **Audio Transcription Testing**:
   - Follow the instructions in `sample-audio-instructions.md` to obtain sample audio files.
   - Use these files with the reference system proof-of-concept to test audio transcription and timestamp references.

3. **Batch Processing Testing**:
   - Create a directory with multiple sample files to test the batch processing capabilities.

## Creating Your Own Test Data

When creating your own test data for development purposes, consider the following:

1. **Variety**: Include a mix of different entity types (people, locations, organizations, dates, etc.).
2. **Complexity**: Create scenarios with varying levels of complexity to test the system's capabilities.
3. **Realism**: Make the data as realistic as possible to simulate real-world use cases.
4. **Privacy**: Ensure that any test data does not contain actual sensitive or personal information.
