[START OF RECORDING]

Det. Johnson: This is Detective Sarah Johnson, badge number 4872, conducting an interview with Michael Rodriguez on June 11, 2025, at 2:30 PM at Central Police Station. Also present is Officer Thomas Wilson. Mr. Rodriguez, do you understand that this interview is being recorded?

Rodriguez: Yes, I understand.

Det. Johnson: And you've been advised of your rights?

Rodriguez: Yes, I have.

Det. Johnson: Mr. Rodriguez, can you tell me about your whereabouts on the night of June 8, between 10 PM and midnight?

Rodriguez: I was at The Blue Note Bar on 5th Avenue until about 10:30 PM. Then I walked home to my apartment at 789 Oak Street. It's about a 20-minute walk. I got home around 10:50 PM and stayed in for the rest of the night.

Det. Johnson: Did anyone see you at The Blue Note or on your walk home?

Rodriguez: Yeah, I was with my friend David Chen at the bar. We had a couple of beers and then left together. He walked with me about halfway before heading to his place on Maple Drive.

Det. Johnson: And what time did David leave you?

Rodriguez: Around 10:40 PM, at the corner of 5th and Pine.

Det. Johnson: Did you see anyone else on your walk home?

Rodriguez: Not that I remember. It was pretty quiet that night.

Det. Johnson: Mr. Rodriguez, are you familiar with Westside Pawn Shop on 3rd Avenue?

Rodriguez: [pause] I've been there a few times. Why?

Det. Johnson: When was the last time you visited Westside Pawn?

Rodriguez: Maybe a month ago? I sold an old watch there.

Det. Johnson: Not more recently? Say, on June 8th?

Rodriguez: No, definitely not. Like I said, I was at The Blue Note and then went straight home.

Det. Johnson: Mr. Rodriguez, we have security footage showing someone matching your description entering Westside Pawn at 11:20 PM on June 8th. The shop was broken into and approximately $5,000 worth of jewelry was stolen.

Rodriguez: [agitated] That wasn't me. I told you, I was home by 10:50. Check my building's security cameras. I used my key fob to get in.

Det. Johnson: We're in the process of obtaining that footage. Do you own a black hoodie with a red logo on the back?

Rodriguez: [pause] Yes, I do. It's a RedWolf brand hoodie. Lots of people have those.

Det. Johnson: The person in the security footage was wearing a similar hoodie. They also had a distinctive tattoo on their right hand, similar to the one you have.

Rodriguez: [defensive] This is ridiculous. I didn't break into any pawn shop. I was home. Check my phone records. I was texting with my girlfriend, Lisa Martinez, after I got home.

Det. Johnson: What time were you texting Ms. Martinez?

Rodriguez: From about 11:00 PM until midnight or so. She'll confirm it.

Det. Johnson: We'll check with Ms. Martinez. Do you know anyone who might want to frame you for this crime?

Rodriguez: [thinking] Well, there's this guy, Jake Thompson. We had a fight at The Blue Note about two weeks ago. He got kicked out and threatened to "get me back" somehow. He knows where I live and what I look like.

Det. Johnson: Can you describe Jake Thompson?

Rodriguez: White guy, about my height, similar build. He's got dark hair too, but his is shorter. He has tattoos on both arms and hands. We used to work together at City Auto Repair on 10th Street until he got fired for stealing.

Det. Johnson: When did he work at City Auto Repair?

Rodriguez: Until about three months ago. The owner, Frank Miller, caught him stealing parts and fired him on the spot.

Det. Johnson: Have you seen Jake Thompson since your altercation at The Blue Note?

Rodriguez: No, but he's sent me threatening messages on social media. I blocked him, but my friend David said he's been asking about me.

Det. Johnson: I'd like to see those messages if you still have access to them.

Rodriguez: I can try to recover them. They should be in my blocked messages folder.

Det. Johnson: That would be helpful. Now, going back to the night of June 8th, did you notice anything unusual when you got home or during the night?

Rodriguez: Not really. It was a normal Sunday night. I watched some TV, texted with Lisa, and went to bed around 1 AM.

Det. Johnson: And you didn't leave your apartment at all after 10:50 PM?

Rodriguez: No, I didn't leave until the next morning when I went to work at 8 AM.

Det. Johnson: Where do you work, Mr. Rodriguez?

Rodriguez: I'm a mechanic at Eastside Auto Shop on 15th Street. I've been there for about six months now.

Det. Johnson: And you were at work on Monday, June 9th?

Rodriguez: Yes, from 8 AM to 5 PM. My boss, Helen Garcia, can confirm that.

Det. Johnson: Alright, Mr. Rodriguez. We'll be checking your alibi, including the building security footage, your phone records, and we'll speak with Ms. Martinez, Mr. Chen, and Ms. Garcia. Is there anything else you'd like to add to your statement at this time?

Rodriguez: Just that I'm innocent. I didn't break into that pawn shop. I think Jake Thompson might be trying to set me up. He's got a record, you know. Check him out.

Det. Johnson: We'll look into all leads. Thank you for your time, Mr. Rodriguez. This concludes the interview. The time is now 3:45 PM.
